        \textbf{Research Question:}
        To what extent does changing the length of a circular cantilever beam affect its resonant frequency, and how well does the theoretical model predict this relationship?

\section{Introduction}%500

    Cantilever beams, seemingly simple elements used in construction where one end of a beam is solidly attached and the other loose, has played a major role in engineering, historically they were used for purely mechanical structures such as buildings, cranes and balconies.
    \autocite{BuildingConstructionBook}\\
    While the use of such simple elements is still common in archaic construction, their utility expands far beyond macroscopic architecture, Nowadays cutting edge technology such as MEMS(micro-electromechanical) systems which bridge electrical and mechanical systems on the semiconductor level, use such structures as well, microscopic strain gauges being used in gyroscopes to sense tiny acceleration forces.
    \autocite{MemsBook}%Analysis and Design Principles of MEMS Devices

    An important property of cantilever beams is their resonant frequency, this is the frequency which the beam will

    Personally, I was impressed that such simple structures was in the core of such advanced technology we take for granted today, gyroscopes and accelometers are the core of car safety systems and mobile device tracking.
