I am fortunate to have picked my topic as early I have, I was initially planning on making the topic on input shaping and the resonance of more complex systems, but I quickly realised that was beyond my capabilities and an extended essay wouldn't be long enough to explain it to the depth that I wanted to, so I have decided to analyse a simpler system.  
I am glad to have picked out physics as my topic since i believe my capabilities in the topic is plenty and I know how to do research. I will first focus on expanding my knowledge in the field of Euler mechanics and fourrier transformations by listening to college lectures and reading material, citing the material according to the MLA standard.
Since the problem is mostly pure mathematics, a simulation and a primitive experiment, the ethics are generally unambiguous, even then, I will specifically try to avoid software and hardware that has unethical origins and use Free, open source software where possible.

Even though the progress of the essay was slowed down by factors out of my control. I have, to the best of my ability kept the essay moving forward, one of the largest roadblocks I encountered was the unexpected depth of the mathematics that the topic needs, from partial differential equations to finite element analysis, the more I went on, the more I realised this was a huge undertaking for me, and needed to simplify the writing several times according to my plan(mainly that the background knowledge section should be less than ¼ of the essay), and decided not to focus on the mathematics of the frequency analysis or the finite element analysis, but just ro present the data output and the the steps to reproduce the experiments. If I were to start over, i would choose to only do about ⅓ of the topic, e.g. only focusing on the mathematics and not including the experiment and simulation, even then, I do not regret choosing this topic, I just believe that I could have chosen a topic that is less of a time investment.

The schedule is on fire, the deadline creeps closer and I cannot do anything but focus on other things, I honestly believe that the scheduling is the weakest part of my extended essay, and the root cause of many more issues. Even though I started early, the progress just wasn't quick enough. Even then, I am glad to have written in this topic, learning about things I will eventually learn in university, essentially giving me an advantage in the future, this also gave an opportunity to improve my 3d modelling skills, one that I was unable to find the time for otherwise. Frankly, the 3 lengths of beams I have used, while confirming the theory, is not enough to draw any full conclusions, so I would definitely like to re-do the experiment with more samples, and maybe a thinner bar, since I believe that's one of the biggest reasons for the small discrepancy from the theory.
While writing, I found that working at night was the most effective for me, especially at the weekends to not mess up my sleeping schedule, the lack of distractions and the fact that I don't have any distractions improves my efficiency greatly.
